My name is Tatiana Portsova. I grew up in Russia, in a small town in Siberia. Since 2012, I've been living in the USA.
I have an interest in drawing, you're more than welcome to click on the link to my instagram account and check out some of my works.
I'm currently studying Data Science at Lambda school. That's a facinating field, and I'm looking forward to learning more. 
I'm interested in doing an analitical job and working for companies that provide inisghts on data.


What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
